Userscripts for Steamgifts

## SG Tags
Ever had the situation where you see a giveaway but you are not sure if you like that game at all or not? 
Do you first look at the tags of a game before deciding if you will like it or not?

I implemented a small user script (currently only tested on Firefox with GreaseMonkey, but should work with Tampermonkey on Chrome as well).
It adds the tags from steam store page on the giveaway heading behind the steam link. Data is provided by my own steam-api proxy for caching purpose (steam api limits access) and because steamapi doesn't support cross orgin policy
